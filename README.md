The design consists of five main parts, 
1) A top housing with integrated water spraying section,
2) A middle housing which acts as a drain to the . .
3) A lower housing which has the pump
4) A rear panel to hold the wiring
5) A set of two gaskets to seal the parts


## Wiring

The wiring is simply

USB 5V --> switch --> LED/pump

## Parts

In addition to the 3D prints you would need
1) Pump = flintronic Submersible Water Pump
2) Switch = RUNCCI-YUN 12mm Waterproof Momentary Push Button
3) LED = 8mm 5V blue panel mount LED
4) A short length of 8mm ID piping

The mechanical files are found in: https://github.com/bigcrimping/finger_washer/tree/main/finger_washer_3MF

The lower requires 4 x M3 brass inserts

The middle acts as a drain and passes through the pipe

## Plug Mold

The rear of the lower contains a drain hole which needs a plug, 
The mold files are here: https://github.com/bigcrimping/finger_washer/tree/main/plug_mold_3MF

Print each half and then use an appropriate material for casting, I used the above files scaled to 120% for a tight fit and to cope with shrinkage.

I used Cataldo Quick-sil

## Gasket

To seal the three pieces I cut two gaskets on a laser cutter although you could probably print a template on paper and cut it out

The DXF is found here: https://github.com/bigcrimping/finger_washer/tree/main/gasket_DXF

I used Flexfoil 2mm gasket paper
